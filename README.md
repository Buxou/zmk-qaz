# Wireless QAZ

A keymap for the [QAZ keyboard](https://www.cbkbd.com/product/qaz-keyboard-kit), using home row mods and some combos.

## TODO

- Cmd+Tab and Ctrl+Tab shortcuts do not work as expected, and need some logic to be usable. I need to investigate how to do that with ZMK, because I have code that solves that in QMK.
- Add a reset button for flashing

## Changelog

- 2021-04-01: enabled deep sleep mode, which will hopefully stop the keyboard from waking up my computer in the middle of the night
